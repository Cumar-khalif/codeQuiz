# codeQuiz
This is a live website. When the user clicks on the start button, a series of functions will trigger. 
The first, a timer that displays time remaining in seconds to users. The second, the first quiz question will appear with four clickable buttons.
 When the user clicks on a button, one of two things will happen. Either the user was correct and the next question appears without any negative effect, or the user was incorrect and seconds will be docked from the time, and the next question will appear. 
 When either the time runs out or the quiz is completed, the timer will stop and a blank space appears to enter your initials If the quiz was completed before the time runs out,the text area will now display a list of high scores pulled from local storage. The initials along with their score, time remaining, will be push into local storage.

In the future, I hope to add images that apply to the questions, A background that isn't a solid color, and add more style that I currently have.
